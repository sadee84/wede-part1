    .HomeKnitt is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing warmth and comfort to the homeless through the simple yet powerful act of knitting. Our mission is to create a sense of community and dignity among those in need by donating handmade blankets and jerseys. What sets us apart is our commitment to empowering marginalized individuals by employing them as knitters, paying them a fair wage of R50 per blanket. This not only provides a source of income but also restores a sense of purpose and self-worth.

Our organization relies solely on donations and fundraising efforts to sustain our operations. We believe in the power of collective action and invite individuals, businesses, and organizations to join us in making a difference. Every donation, no matter how small, brings us closer to our goal of wrapping the homeless in warmth and dignity. Our dedicated team of volunteers and staff work tirelessly to manage the organization, ensuring that every rand donated goes directly towards supporting our mission.

Through HomeKnitt, we aim to address the pressing issue of homelessness in our society, one stitch at a time. By providing essential items like blankets and jerseys, we hope to bring comfort and relief to those struggling to survive on the streets. Moreover, by employing and paying poor individuals to knit these items, we are creating a ripple effect of kindness and economic empowerment. Join us in our mission to spread warmth, dignity, and hope to those who need it most. Together, we can make a difference, one blanket at a time.
